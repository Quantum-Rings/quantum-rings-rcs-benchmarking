# Quantum Rings Amplitude Files

Below is a list of files containing the raw amplitude values from the execution of the RCS circuits, used in the analysis presented in the white paper. Each archive includes multiple output files for circuits with a specific number of qubits, named to correspond to the QASM file executed to produce them.

While we recommend running the original quantum circuits yourself to generate these files, we are providing our own outputs for those who may not have the time to execute the multitude of circuits provided.
